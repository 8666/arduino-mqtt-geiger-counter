On the photo you can see the geiger counter (right) and a plastic box for the arduino and LAN module on the right. All is wall mounted (on a wooden board). The 3 wires between are 5V, GND and DATA.

Be sure to use good power supply as the measurments will be different with sligtlhy different/variable voltage input. 

The geiger coutnr kit should be calibrated. There is a potentiometer that should be ajdusted with a small screwdriver. Also I added heatshrink over the tube, that should eliminate beta radiation and the red tape just mark the positive side.


*Calibration*

TBD
